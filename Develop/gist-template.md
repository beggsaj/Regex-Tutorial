# Regex Tutorial (matching an Email)

Often times a user of an application needs to provide their email address. The application will then need to validate the email. You can do this with RegEx or through a regular expression. 

## Summary

This tutorial will use the regular expression that validates the email. It will break down the parts that go into the expression and provide specific examples of invalid and valid emails.

## Regex Components

These are the characters that have special meaning in regex: ., +, *, ?, ^, $, (, ), [, ], {, }, |, .

### Anchors

Do not match any character, they match a position before, after, or between characters. They are used to “anchor” the regex match at a certain position. This makes it so that there are no extra characters after the end like a space or a new line character that could result from human error.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers dictate how many times a character, group, or character class will occur.

* - Match zero or more times.
+ - Match one or more times.
? - Match zero or one time.
{ n } - Match exactly n times.
{ n ,} - Match at least n times.
{ n , m } - Match from n to m times.
